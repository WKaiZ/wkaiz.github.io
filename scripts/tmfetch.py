"""Shared Transfermarkt fetch layer for the eFootball, WC26 and league builders.

Transfermarkt answers some datacenter IPs -- GitHub Actions runners in
particular -- with an HTTP 200 page that carries no player markup at all. The
builders used to read that as "this player has no portrait": they bumped
tm_null and, after three strikes, blacklisted the id forever. Through late July
2026 that quietly burned 239 ids whose photos exist and froze the shared cache
at 909 entries while every daily run reported 23/23 "null".

So resolution here is three-way, never two-way:

    a URL   -- portrait found
    None    -- the page really is a player profile and says there's no portrait
    Blocked -- anything else; retry later, do NOT record a verdict about the id

"Is a real page" is a positive test (the page has to mention the id we asked
for, or the search form we submitted), because a block page can plausibly carry
a default portrait of its own and must never be mistaken for a null.

Requests walk an ordered list of STRATEGIES: the plain hosts first, then
r.jina.ai, which fetches from its own machines and so sidesteps a block that is
keyed to the runner's IP. The first strategy to return a real page wins and is
remembered for the rest of the process, so a blocked runner pays the failover
cost once rather than on every player. Run this file directly to print which
strategies work from the current host:
