Hello! Welcome to my personal site! I am a fourth-year student at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Data Science.  

My current research interests lie in artificial intelligence and database systems, where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor [Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/) and collaborating closely with, and being mentored by, [Qiuyang Mang](https://joyemang33.github.io/) and [Hans Mao](https://huanzhimao.com/).

I am also currently a TA for [CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://eecs189.org/). Previously, I have served as a TA for [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/), [Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://ds100.org/), and [CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/).
